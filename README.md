# ee-paypal-tls-test
WordPress plugin that checks if your server and WordPress installation are ready for PayPal's upcoming security requirements (see https://devblog.paypal.com/upcoming-security-changes-notice/)

Just upload this plugin via the normal WordPress plugin uploader, and activate it. It will immediately check if your server is capable of communicating with PayPal with their new server requirements, and will give you a notice informing you of the results.
